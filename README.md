Data Collection: The data was collected from kaggle website and modified according to the training planned.(The data currenlty has Month, Weekday and Minutes of a day) as the attributes. The data will get more stonger in future.
Model Training: The ML model trained here is a simple MLP network with non-linear regression. The model had adapted the non-linearity of the data and hence predicts the traffic with +/- 5 as the accuracy.
GUI: The gui manages the data input and the predictor model. It displays the predicted traffic and status of the traffic capacity on road.
